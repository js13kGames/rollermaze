# Dev Diary / Postmortem

This is my eigth game jam entry.

Like in all my previous years entering the competition, just before the theme was announced I created a new project template with updated build and minify steps from my entry last year.

As soon as the theme was announced I had some thoughts as to what kind of game I wanted to create to fit the theme, here as some of my initial thoughts/notes/ideas ..

Triskaidekaphobia
-----------------
* Fear or avoidance of the number 13
* Superstitions, like Friday 13th
* Card number 13 in tarot being "death"
* Unlucky
* Apollo 13, launched at 13:13 with the tank explosion on April 13th

Game ideas
----------
* 13 things to do
* 13 levels of the game
* Given it's a phobia, some kind of hazard or danger element
* Dice forming part of the mechanic with face pips as counters
* I want to try a 3D game again, but this time with WebGL

Here is a rough diary of progress as posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/femtosonic), taken from notes and [commit logs](https://github.com/picosonic/js13k-2024/commits/)..

13th August
-----------
Looking into the [Triskaidekaphobia on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia), and having ideas about possible games.

Padded out build environment and workflow.

Did some tests with [xem's MicroW](https://xem.github.io/microW/) 3D engine.
