  "description": "You play as a cuboctahedron on the run. You have only 13 seconds to get from the drop point to the safety of the woods before you're caught. Some paths are blocked and will need to be opened up using the nearest button. For longer distances you'll need to find a safe spot which will reset the timer. Be careful of the grey sentinel cubes, if you touch them they become active and will send you back to your drop point, then chase you.",
